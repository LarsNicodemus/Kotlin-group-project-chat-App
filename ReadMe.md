# WhatsSyntax - Chat App (Group Project)

This project is an Android chat app called **WhatsSyntax**, developed as part of the **Android App Development with Kotlin** module at the Syntax Institute. It is a group project where the content learned over the past weeks, such as **BottomNavigationView**, **RecyclerView**, **Fragments**, **Intents**, and **Navigation**, was applied practically. The app simulates a simple chat application with features such as status updates, calls, and settings.

## About the App

The **WhatsSyntax** app is a simple chat application that provides the following features:
- **Chats**: Display and management of chat messages.
- **Status**: Display of user status updates.
- **Calls**: Simulation of call functions.
- **Settings**: Management of app settings.

The app was developed in a group, with a focus on teamwork, reinforcing the concepts learned, and creating a shared reference guide.

- **Navigation**: Implementation of navigation between fragments.

## Technologies and Concepts

- **Kotlin**: The programming language for Android development.
- **BottomNavigationView**: A navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.
- **Fragments**: Modular UI components for different sections of the app.
- **RecyclerView**: Efficient display of lists.
- **Intents**: Navigation and data transfer between activities.
- **Navigation Component**: Simplified navigation between fragments.
- **Android Studio**: The official IDE for Android development.

## Project Week Workflow

- **Monday**: Set up `BottomNavigationView` and created the first fragments.
- **Tuesday**: Implemented the `StatusFragment` with `RecyclerView`.
- **Wednesday**: Implemented the `CallsFragment` with implicit intents.
- **Thursday**: Implemented the `ChatsFragment` with advanced `RecyclerView` usage.
- **Friday**: Implemented the `SettingsFragment`, presented the results, and concluded the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LarsNicodemus/Kotlin-group-project-chat-App.git
Open the project in Android Studio.

Build the app and run it on an emulator or physical device.

### Usage
